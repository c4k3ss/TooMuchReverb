TooMuchReverb was developed using [Hise](https://hise.dev/). 
To open the project:

* Select "Open existing project"
* Open the TooMuchReverb folder
* Navigate to "Project Directory"
* In the "Presets" folder, open "Preset.hip"

> **Note**
> Faust and the newest version of HISE (not from the release page) are necessary for the Project to work inside the app. IPP is also recommended

## Download

You can [download](https://github.com/c4k3ss/TooMuchReverb/releases) the latest version of TooMuchReverb for Windows and macOS.

## Credits

I orignally got the idea of making a plugin from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrnGI6ce8fY), so I recommend watching it!

The 3rd Reverb mode is a combination of two reverbs made with [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr/), one of which is [elysiera](https://github.com/azur1s/elysiera?tab=readme-ov-file).
